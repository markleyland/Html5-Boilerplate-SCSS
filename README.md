Html5-Boilerplate-SCSS
======================

HTML5 Boilerplate Customised for SCSS &amp; SMACCS

This is the Html5 Boilerplate customised to use SCSS with the folder structure setup for the SMACCS style guide. 

I sectioned some of the original boilerplate main.css into partials and placed them into the relevant catagories
within the folder structure to conform with SMACCS. I took out all the helper classed from main.css and created a 
partial for those in the tools folder. The rest of the main.css file has been renamed base.scss and placed in the base 
folder. I also converted the normalize.css into .scss and placed that in the base folder.

Other than what comes with the boilerplate no styles have been added.
